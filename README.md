# Fractal-Dimension
It is the Relative Modified Improved Box Counting Method.
Calculate Fractal Dimension for Grayscale and Colour Images using Box Count Method

This code is for calculation of fractal dimension of grayscale as well as color images. This is a new method developed by us. 
For grayscale.m, it uses the box count method as its base and then using the graph that is plotted by using the number of boxes and scale, the best fit line is calculated, the slope of which gives us the required fractal dimension of the image.
For color images, three new methods are developed. 
These codes can be used for further study of fractal dimension of images and can be used for classification purposes, tumour detection, etc. The codes are tested and ready to work. These codes are used for further study in the application of fractal dimesnion in various fields. 

All the codes are written in MATLAB. 

Jupyter Notebook for color_1.m has been added. (Python3 version)
